Interest of content
- Excellent
Interesting content helped by interactive elements

Consistency and quality of visual presentation
- Acceptable
Attempts to use animations and other highly stylised elements in the page but very inconsistently so between pages the site feels very inconsistent
Nav bar does not play well when resizing window
Also maybe use page titles in the nav rather than author's names
one page adds a drop down to the nav that doesn't flow nice with the rest of the site

Quality of written presentation
- Very Good
Well organised pages however the page on personal assistants makes it fairly unintuitive to access the information on the other two cards

Validity of HTML
- Excellent
There are no faults I can see with the html content is divided into divs and indented properly - maybe try using some html5 contextual tags though

Evidence of collaboration
- Excellent
All users have large and similar amounts of contributions on the repository

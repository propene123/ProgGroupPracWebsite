							Siri is Apple's Personal Assistant that is available on Mac, iPhone, iPad, and the Apple Watch. It was first released in 2010 as an app before it 
							was purchased by Apple and re-released as a feature only available for the iPhone 4S.
							Siri was one of the first digital Persoanal Assistants to really become popular due to Apple's large following. Siri is activated using the home button on handheld Apple devices
							and is then given a command that is sent to Apple's servers to be processed using voice recognition methods and machine learning to decide how to correctly respond to requests.
							Siri has benefitted people in many ways an extreme example being how <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-london-39352286/boy-4-uses-siri-to-help-save-mum-s-life">a child was able to contact emergency services to save his mother's life</a>.
							Although Siri is more often used for more mundane tasks such as making phone calls.
						</p>
						<p>Although originally inovative Siri has fallen behind Google and Amazons respective Personal Assistants that provide better voice recognition and can understand more complex requests than Siri.</p>

							Alexa is an increasingly possible in home Personal Assistant created by Amazon that is available in the form of various sized speakers.
							Alexa Listens for a wake word that can be changed (Alexa by default) and upon hearing said word listens to what the user says until there is a pause in speech.
							The audio recording is then sent over the internet to Amazon's servers where it is processed using Natural Language Processing (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>)
							so that the server can process the data. Alexa uses machine learning to decide how to respond to the users query. The power of Alexa comes from
							the fact that there are thousands of people using it meaning it can learn how to better respond rapidly due to the large amount of requests it gets.
							Alexa then uses Natural language generation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation">NLG</a>) to respond to the user
							in their language of choice. 
						</p>
						<h3>Privacy Concerns</h3>
						<p>Alexa has raised provacy concerns though. Since all the requests the user makes are sent to be stored on Amazon's servers background conversations may be picked up
						   requests and having such personal information stored by a third party company does raise concerns. Many people are also concerned that since Alexa is always
						   listening for its wake word then it could be sending all recorded sound to Amazon's servers to be used for AD Profiling, this has been constantly denied by
						   Amazon. However this does little to quell peoples concerns.

							Bixby is Samsungs Personal Assistant for their mobile phones. Bixby serves the user in 2 different ways:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Voice recognition<br><ul>
								<li>The user of Bixby enabled device can long press the Bixby button on their smartphone or call for Bixby allowing them to issue a voice command to Bixby.
									The voice command is sent to a server to be processed into a representation that can be processed by a computer. Bixby uses machine learning to learn how 
									to properly respond to the users query, the vast number of users that make requests to Bixby and give feeback on the responses allow for it to build a better model 
									of how to respond (e.g. launch a certain app).
								</li>
							</ul></li>
							<li>Providing Information<br><ul>
								<li>Bixby uses machine learning to build a model of what the user of a particular device is interested in. The user can access this information by short pressing the Bixby button 
									to launch Bixby Home. This allows them to view recommended apps to launch based on what they usually use at that time of the day. It can also provide fitness information for the user 
									based on how many steps the device has detected. This can all make the users life that little be smoother e.g. when leaving work, if you usually take an Uber home, Bixby will have the 
									Uber app ready in Bixby Home because it had predicted you will need it.
								</li>
							</ul></li>

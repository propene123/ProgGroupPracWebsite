Interest of content:
Very good. 
Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
Very good. However the search bar did not work on all pages. I am still waiting for the boat race to finish. The dropdown bar on Little Ben's page could be placed in a more obvious location.
Quality of written Presentation:
Weak. The inconsistent dropping of full stops on Rory's page needs fixing. Big ben's page was good. However, the side was truely let down by Little ben. He really dropped the ball. "Alexa is an increasingly possible in home Personal Assistant" - Benjamin Russel, 2018. I could go on but it would be easier to copy and paste the entire page. 
Validity of HTML:
Exemplary. I found no errors.
Evidence of collaboration:
Excellent.
